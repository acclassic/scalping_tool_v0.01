This is a test project I created last year to learn more about crypto, golang websocket implementation, goroutines for concurrency and more.Â **THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE WINNINGS!!!**

The idea behind this is to use the different crypto markets on binance to make profit by simple triangular arbitrage. While in theory this works, in practice it doesn't. The main reason is that Binance limits the amount of digits after the decimal point. Therefore, the small profit gets eaten up by the slippage.
