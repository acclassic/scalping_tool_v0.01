This is a test project I created last year to learn more about crypto, golang websocket implementation, goroutines for concurrency and more. ## IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE WINNINGS!!!

The idea behind this is to use the different crypto markets on binance to make profit by simple tringular arbitrage. While on theory this works in practice it dosen't. The main reason is that Binance limits the amout of digits after the decimal point. Therfore the small profit gets eaten up by the slipage.
